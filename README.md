## **Inferential Statistics**

### Author: **Marlon Marin**

### Description: 
Use of hypothesis tests and conduct some inferential stats algorithms are relevant for further DS and ML projects,
here I condense two practices and useful code to glide over this subject.

## Requirements

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) >= 4.x
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) >= 2.x
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0:
    This can be installed via `pip` or `conda` depending on how you manage Python packages:
